# Hisaaber - ‡§π‡§ø‡§∏‡§æ‡§¨er

A smart digital ledger app for shopkeepers, designed to quickly calculate totals from handwritten bills using the power of OCR.

---

## üìú Project Description

Hisaaber solves the daily hassle for shopkeepers of manually calculating the total bill amount for each customer from handwritten lists. This process is time-consuming, prone to errors, and can lead to a poor customer experience.

This app allows a shopkeeper to simply take a picture of an item-price list. Using a powerful cloud-based OCR engine, it recognizes the text, parses the items and prices, and calculates the gross total in seconds. Each bill is saved locally for fast, offline access and can be synced to the cloud for backup.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **üì∑ Scan & Calculate:** Instantly calculate bill totals by taking a picture of a handwritten or printed list.
* **ü§ñ AI-Powered OCR:** Utilizes a powerful cloud-based OCR service (OCR.space) for high accuracy on various text types.
* **üñºÔ∏è Image Pre-processing:** Includes in-app tools to crop and automatically clean up images (deskewing, binarization) to maximize recognition accuracy.
* **üíæ Offline First:** All bills and user data are saved to a local on-device database (Hive) for instant access, even without an internet connection.
* **üë§ User Profiles:** Simple user profiles with customizable names and avatars.
* **üìú Detailed History:** A complete, searchable history of all past transactions.
* **üìå Pin & Dismiss:** Users can pin important bills to the top of their recent list and swipe to hide others.
* **üîÑ Pull-to-Refresh:** A familiar pull-to-refresh gesture on the home screen to update the list.

        ```sh
        flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
        ```
    * Configure your native splash screen in `pubspec.yaml` and run:
        ```sh

### Disclosure
For the current project version, it cannot provide results with 100% accuracy, because the good OCR models (like the Google Vision API) are paid features and due to budget issues, other less accurate OCR services have been used.
